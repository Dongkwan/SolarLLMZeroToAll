    "## Explanation of the Code: Smart Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",

    "### High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates a smart Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines local retrieval with external search capabilities. The main goal is to provide relevant context for answering user questions by first searching a local vector database and then falling back to an external search service if the local context is insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code defines two main functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. is_in: Determines whether the answer to a given question can be found within the provided context.\n",
    "smart_rag: Retrieves relevant context for a given question, either from the local vector database or an external search service, and generates an answer using the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The code uses the LangChain library for generating prompts and invoking language models, as well as the Tavily API for external search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code starts by defining the is_in function, which takes a question and context as input and determines whether the answer to the question can be found within the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It defines a prompt template called is_in_conetxt that asks the language model to check if the answer is in the context and return \"yes\" or \"no\".\n",
    "  * The prompt template is used to create a ChatPromptTemplate object.\n",
    "  * A chain of operations is constructed using the | operator:\n",
    "    * The ChatPromptTemplate is passed to the ChatUpstage model.\n",
    "    * The model's output is parsed using the StrOutputParser.\n",
    "  * The chain is invoked with the question and context, and the response is stored in the response variable.\n",
    "  * The function returns True if the response starts with \"yes\" (case-insensitive), indicating that the answer is in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code then demonstrates the usage of the is_in function with two example questions and their corresponding contexts retrieved from a retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Next, the code defines the smart_rag function, which takes a question as input and generates an answer using the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It first retrieves the context for the question using the retriever.invoke method.\n",
    "  * If the is_in function determines that the answer is not in the retrieved context, it falls back to searching for additional context using the Tavily API.\n",
    "  * The retrieved context (either from the local retriever or Tavily) is stored in the context variable.\n",
    "  * A chain of operations is constructed using the | operator:\n",
    "    * The rag_with_history_prompt (not shown in the code snippet) is used as the prompt template.\n",
    "    * The prompt is passed to the llm language model.\n",
    "    * The model's output is parsed using the StrOutputParser.\n",
    "  * The chain is invoked with the conversation history, retrieved context, and the question, and the generated answer is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finally, the code demonstrates the usage of the smart_rag function with two example questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * \"What is DUS?\": The answer is expected to be found in the local context.\n",
    "  * \"What's the population of San Francisco?\": The answer is not expected to be found in the local context, so it falls back to searching with Tavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code showcases how LangChain can be used to build a smart RAG system that combines local retrieval with external search capabilities. By first searching a local vector database and falling back to an external search service if needed, the system aims to provide relevant context for generating accurate answers to user questions."

    "\n",
    "### High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code demonstrates how to perform a groundedness check using the LangChain library and the Upstage model. The groundedness check is a process of verifying whether the generated response is grounded in the given context. This is an important step in ensuring the quality and relevance of the generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses the `UpstageGroundednessCheck` class from the `langchain_upstage` module to perform the groundedness check. It takes the context (a string of unique documents) and the generated response as input, and returns a verdict indicating whether the response is grounded or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code starts by importing the necessary module:\n",
    "   - `UpstageGroundednessCheck` from `langchain_upstage`: This class is used to perform the groundedness check.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An instance of the `UpstageGroundednessCheck` class is created and assigned to the variable `groundedness_check`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The input for the groundedness check is prepared by creating a dictionary called `request_input`:\n",
    "   - The `\"context\"` key is assigned the value of `str(unique_docs)`, which represents the unique documents as a string.\n",
    "   - The `\"answer\"` key is assigned the value of `response`, which represents the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `invoke` method of the `groundedness_check` instance is called with the `request_input` as an argument. This method performs the groundedness check and returns the verdict.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The verdict is stored in the `response` variable and printed to the console using `print(response)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The code then checks if the `response` starts with the word \"grounded\" (case-insensitive):\n",
    "   - If the response starts with \"grounded\", it means the groundedness check has passed, and the message \"✅ Groundedness check passed\" is printed.\n",
    "   - If the response does not start with \"grounded\", it means the groundedness check has failed, and the message \"❌ Groundedness check failed\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code demonstrates a simple yet effective way to perform a groundedness check using LangChain and Upstage. By verifying whether the generated response is grounded in the given context, it helps ensure the quality and relevance of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Groundedness checks are an important step in building reliable and trustworthy language models and conversational agents. They help prevent the generation of irrelevant, inconsistent, or factually incorrect responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `UpstageGroundednessCheck` class from LangChain, developers can easily integrate groundedness checks into their language model pipelines and improve the overall performance of their systems."

    "Let's break down the code and explain each part in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing necessary modules:\n",
    "   - `tool` from `langchain_core.tools`: This module provides the `@tool` decorator for defining custom tools.\n",
    "   - `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests to external APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining the `add` tool:\n",
    "   - The `@tool` decorator is used to define the `add` function as a custom tool.\n",
    "   - The function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.\n",
    "   - The docstring provides a brief description of the tool's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Defining the `multiply` tool:\n",
    "   - Similar to the `add` tool, the `multiply` function is defined as a custom tool using the `@tool` decorator.\n",
    "   - It takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their product.\n",
    "   - The docstring describes the tool's purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Defining the `get_news` tool:\n",
    "   - The `get_news` function is defined as a custom tool using the `@tool` decorator.\n",
    "   - It takes a `topic` parameter of type `str` and returns news articles related to that topic.\n",
    "   - The function constructs a URL for the news API using the provided topic and an API key stored in an environment variable.\n",
    "   - It sends a GET request to the API using the `requests` library and returns the JSON response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Creating a list of tools:\n",
    "   - The `tools` list is created, containing the `add`, `multiply`, and `get_news` tools.\n",
    "   - This list will be used to bind the tools to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Binding the tools to the language model:\n",
    "   - The `bind_tools` method of the `llm` object is called, passing the `tools` list as an argument.\n",
    "   - This step binds the custom tools to the language model, allowing it to utilize these tools when generating responses.\n",
    "   - The resulting object is assigned to the variable `llm_with_tools`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates how to create custom tools in LangChain, which can be used to extend the capabilities of language models. By defining tools for specific tasks, such as mathematical operations or retrieving news articles, developers can enhance the functionality of their LangChain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@tool` decorator simplifies the process of defining custom tools, while the `bind_tools` method allows seamless integration of these tools with the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging custom tools, LangChain enables developers to build powerful and versatile applications that can perform a wide range of tasks beyond simple text generation.\n"
